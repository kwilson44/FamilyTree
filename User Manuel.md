You can either run the Tester class or run the Driver class. 
The driver class will instruct you how to create the tree and add family member. For 
example, it'll prompt you to type a string for the root then you can either enter Done to
quit the program or enter 1 to add a child. When adding a child, you'll first enter the
parent node and then the child node.

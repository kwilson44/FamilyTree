User Manuel: You can either run the Tester class or run the Driver class. 
The driver class will instruct you how to create the tree and add family member. For 
example, it'll prompt you to type a string for the root then you can either enter Done to
quit the program or enter 1 to add a child. When adding a child, you'll first enter the
parent node and then the child node.

External Resources: I went to GeeksForGeeks for help with the general tree. I was also inspired by the in class
presentations and went to GeeksForGeeks for HashMaps and Maps to help with coloring/tracking the edges 
that connected the nodes. Also, regarding colors I went to Oracle to learn about the Color class for colors I wanted
for the edges. Oracle also helped me with the font of the nodes. All links listed below.

My own: As mentioned eariler, I had to teach myself how to do a general tree. I used the 
article from above and former homework to curate the most suitable general tree for this project.
Also, I knew, for the nodes, I would have to use Hw6 and Hw7 to implement the Tree's node class so it 
could be both used as a vertex that can be drawn/tracked and be a tree's child. Making sure all the node
references were correct was a bit of a journey but everything came together in the end.

What to add if there was more time: During the exam period/ if I had more time, I would like to 
make it possible to delete family members/nodes. I would also like to add horizontal lines that 
indicate if they are siblings or not. Additionally, I would like to implement a traversal method
to search for specific nodes in the general tree.

Implementation details

External Resources: I went to GeeksForGeeks for help with the general tree. I was also inspired by the in class
presentations and went to GeeksForGeeks for HashMaps and Maps to help with coloring/tracking the edges 
that connected the nodes. Also, regarding colors I went to Oracle to learn about the Color class for colors I wanted
for the edges. Oracle also helped me with the font of the nodes. All links listed below.

My own: As mentioned eariler, I had to teach myself how to do a general tree. I used the 
article from above and former homework to curate the most suitable general tree for this project.
Also, I knew, for the nodes, I would have to use Hw6 and Hw7 to implement the Tree's node class so it 
could be both used as a vertex that can be drawn/tracked and be a tree's child. Making sure all the node
references were correct was a bit of a journey but everything came together in the end.

What to add if there was more time: If I had more time, I would like to 
make it possible to delete family members/nodes. I would also like to add horizontal lines that 
indicate if they are siblings or not. Additionally, with the time during reading period I implemented
 a traversal method prefix,postfix,and infix for the general FamilyTree class and binary search for the 
 BinaryFamilyTree.
